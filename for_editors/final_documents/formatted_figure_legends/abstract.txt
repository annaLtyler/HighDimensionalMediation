Although many genes are subject to local regulation, recent evidence  suggests that complex distal regulation may be more important in  mediating phenotypic variability. To assess the role of  distal gene regulation in complex traits, we combine  multi-tissue transcriptomes with physiological outcomes to model  diet-induced obesity and metabolic disease in a population of  Diversity Outbred mice. Using a novel high-dimensional mediation analysis,  we identify a composite transcriptome signature that summarizes  genetic effects on gene expression and explains 30% of the variation  across all metabolic traits. The signature is heritable, interpretable  in biological terms, and predicts obesity status from gene expression  in an independently derived mouse cohort and multiple human studies.  Transcripts contributing most strongly to this composite mediator frequently  have complex, distal regulation distributed throughout the genome. These  results suggest that trait-relevant variation in transcription is largely  distally regulated, but is nonetheless identifiable, interpretable, and  translatable across species.
