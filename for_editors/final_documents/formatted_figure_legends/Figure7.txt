Transcription, but not local genotype, predicts phenotype in the CC-RIX. <b>A.</b> Workflow showing procedure for translating HDMA results to an independent population of mice. <b>B.</b> Relationships between the predicted metabolic disease index (MDI) and the mean of the rank normal body weight. In this column, MDI was derived from measured transcripts. Adipose - <i>R<sup>2</sup></i> = 0.60; beta coefficient = 0.89±0.17 standard error; <i>t</i> = 5.21; <i>p</i> = 5.9×10<sup>−5</sup>. Liver - <i>R<sup>2</sup></i> = 0.35; beta coefficient = 1.1±0.34 standard error; <i>t</i> = 3.1; <i>p</i> = 6.4×10<sup>−3</sup>. Muscle - <i>R<sup>2</sup></i> = 0.29; beta coefficient = 0.64±0.24 standard error; <i>t</i> = 2.7; <i>p</i> = 0.014. <b>C.</b> In this column, MDI was derived from transcripts imputed from local genotype. Adipose - <i>R<sup>2</sup></i> = 8.0×10<sup>−4</sup>; beta coefficient = −0.2±0.16 standard error; <i>t</i> = −0.12; <i>p</i> = 0.91. Liver - <i>R<sup>2</sup></i> = 0.035; beta coefficient = 0.13±0.16 standard error; <i>t</i> = 0.81; <i>p</i> = 0.43. Muscle - <i>R<sup>2</sup></i> = 0.079; beta coefficient = 0.19±0.16 standard error; <i>t</i> = 1.24; <i>p</i>= 0.23. Gray boxes indicate measured quantities and blue boxes indicate calculated quantities. G - genome; T - transcriptome; P - phenome (here MDI). The dots in each panel represent individual CC-RIX strains. Each strain was represented by between 19 and 24 individuals. The gray lines show the standard deviation of mean body weight for the strain. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.
