Clinical overview. <b>A.</b> Distributions of final body weight in female (green) and male (blue) diversity outbred mice. The average B6 female and male adult weights at 24 weeks of age are indicated by green and blue bars respectively on the <i>x</i>-axis. <b>B.</b> Distributions of fasting glucose in female (green) and male (blue) DO mice. Normal (green), pre-diabetic (yellow), and diabetic (red) fasting glucose ranges for mice are shown by colored bars along the <i>x</i>-axis. <b>C.</b> Males (blue <i>n</i> = 242) had higher fasting blood glucose on average (mean = 170.0 mg/dL) than females (green <i>n</i> = 240, mean = 136) (two-sided Welch’s <i>t</i> test: <i>t</i> = 8.02, df = 428.9, 95% CI of difference = 25.4 to 42.0 mg/dL; <i>p</i> = 1.05 ×10<sup>−14</sup>). Lines in boxes correspond to the median; lower and upper edges of boxes indicate the first and third quartiles; whiskers indicate the first and third quartiles ±1.5 times the interquartile range; dots indicate outliers beyond 1.5 times the interquartile range. <b>D.</b> The relationship between food consumption and body weight for female (green) and male (blue) DO mice. (Linear regression R<sup>2</sup> = 0.51; beta coefficient = 12.6±0.57 standard error; <i>t</i> = 22.2; <i>p</i> < 2.2<sup>−16</sup>). <b>E.</b> Relationship between body weight and fasting glucose for female (green) and male (blue) DO mice. (Linear regression R<sup>2</sup> = 0.21; beta coefficient = 2.49±0.22 standard error; <i>t</i> = 11.34; <i>p</i> 2.2−16). In D and E, blue lines show line of best fit. <b>F.</b> Data presented are heritability estimates for each physiological trait. Bars show standard error of each estimate. The number of animals used in each estimate is shown in parentheses after each trait name. <b>G.</b> Correlation structure between pairs of physiological traits. The upper and lower triangle show the Pearson correlation coefficients (<i>r</i>) between LOD traces of trait pairs (blue) and trait pairs (purple) respectively. The diagonal (orange) shows the estimated heritability of each trait. BMD - bone mineral density, WPIC - whole pancreas insulin content, Glu tAUC - glucose total area under the curve, HOMA IR - homeostatic measurement of insulin resistance, HOMA B - homeostatic measure of beta cell health, VLDL - very low-density lipoprotein, LDL - low-density lipoprotein, IDL - intermediate density lipoprotein, HDL - high-density lipoprotein, TG - triglyceride.
