Transcript heritability and trait relevance. <b>A.</b> Distributions of local (brown) and distal (gray) heritability of transcripts across the four tissues. Overall local and distal factors contribute equally to transcript heritability. Each distribution contains 14102 transcripts. Numbers below distributions indicate the median and standard deviation of each. <b>B.</b> local (brown) and <b>C.</b> distal (gray) heritability and trait relevance across all four tissues. Here trait relevance is defined as the maximum correlation between the transcript and all traits. The upper and lower dashed line in each panel show the 95<sup>th</sup> and 5<sup>th</sup> percentile correlation respectively. The solid line shows the mean trait correlation in transcripts with increasing variance explained either locally (B) or distally (C). Transcripts that are highly correlated with traits tend to have low local heritability and high distal heritability. All <i>p</i> values from Spearman rank correlation tests are two-sided. No adjustments were made for multiple comparisons. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.
