Transcripts with high loadings have high distal heritability and literature support. Each panel has a bar plot showing the loadings of transcripts selected by different criteria. Bar color indicates the tissue of origin. The heat map shows the local (L - left) and distal (D - right) heritability of each transcript. <b>A.</b> Loadings for the 10 transcripts with the largest positive loadings and the 10 transcripts with the largest negative loadings for each tissue. Mean distal heritability (31.8%) was significantly higher than mean local heritability (5%) (two-sided Welch’s t-test <i>t</i> = 16.4; df = 100.2; difference 95% CI = 0.24 to 0.30; <i>p</i><2.2−16). <b>B.</b> Loadings of TWAS candidates with the 10 largest positive correlations with traits and the largest negative correlations with traits across all four tissues. Mean local (15%) and distal (20%) heritability were not significantly different for this group of transcripts (two-sided Welch’s t-test <i>t</i> = 1.9; df = 151.7; difference 95% CI = -0.002 to 0.1; <i>p</i> = 0.77). <b>C.</b> The transcripts with the largest local heritability (top 20) across all four tissues. Mean local heritability (90%) was significantly higher than mean distal heritability (15%) of these genes (two-sided Welch’s <i>t</i> = 45.0; df = 82.0; difference 95% CI = 0.72 to 0.78; <i>p</i> <2.2<sup>−16</sup>). Lines in boxes correspond to the median; lower and upper edges of boxes indicate the first and third quartiles; whiskers indicate the first and third quartiles ±1.5 times the interquartile range; dots indicate outliers beyond 1.5 times the interquartile range. All <i>p</i> values derived from two-sided Welch’s t-test and are not adjusted for multiple comparisons. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.
