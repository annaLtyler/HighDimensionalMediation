High-dimensional mediation. <b>A.</b> Workflow indicating major steps of high-dimensional mediation. The genotype, transcriptome, and phenotype matrices were kernelized to yield single matrices representing the relationships between all individuals for each data modality (<i>G<sub>K</sub></i> = genome kernel, <i>T<sub>K</sub></i> = transcriptome kernel; <i>P<sub>K</sub></i> = phenome kernel). High-dimensional mediation was applied to these matrices to maximize the direct path <i>G</i>→<i>T</i>→<i>P</i>, the mediating pathway (arrows), while simultaneously minimizing the direct <i>G</i>→<i>P</i> pathway (dotted line). The composite vectors that resulted from high-dimensional mediation were <i>G<sub>C</sub></i>, <i>T<sub>C</sub></i>, and <i>P<sub>C</sub></i>. The partial correlations ρ between these vectors indicated perfect mediation. Transcript and trait loadings were calculated as described in the methods. <b>B.</b> The null distribution of the path coefficient derived from 10,000 permutations. Comparisons are shown to the observed path coefficient (red) the path coefficient using a distal-only model (gray) and the path coefficient using the local-only model (brown). <b>C.</b> The null distribution of the <i>G<sub>C</sub></i>-<i>T<sub>C</sub></i> correlation vs. the <i>T<sub>C</sub></i>-<i>P<sub>C</sub></i> correlation. Comparisons are shown to the observed values (red), and those derived from the distal-only model (gray) and the local-only model (brown). Source data are provided as a Source Data file.
