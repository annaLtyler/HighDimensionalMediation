Tissue-specific transcriptional programs are associated with obesity and insulin resistance. <b>A</b> Heatmap showing the loadings of all transcripts with loadings greater than 2.5 standard deviations from the mean in any tissue. The heat map was clustered using <i>k</i> medoid clustering. Functional enrichments of each cluster are indicated along the left margin. <b>B</b> Loadings for <i>Pparg</i> in different tissues indicated by color. <b>C.<b> Local(brown) and distal (gray) of <i>Pparg</i> expression in different tissues.
