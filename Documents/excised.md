### eQTL description from main text

As has been shown previously \cite{pmid29567659}, 
the number of significant local eQTLs exceeded the number of significant 
distal eQTLs at a permutation-based genome-wide p value threshold of 0.01 
(Supp. Fig. \ref{fig:eQTL}F). and tended to be shared across 
tissues (Supp. Fig. \ref{fig:eQTL}G) whereas the few significant distal 
eQTLs we identified tended to be tissue-specific (Supp. Fig. \ref{fig:eQTL}H)
